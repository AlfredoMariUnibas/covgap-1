# COVGAP
#### COVID-19 Genome Analysis Pipeline, for whole genome sequencing and annotation of SARS-CoV-2
## Introduction:
COVGAP will process the raw demultiplexed short reads (Illumina) produced by an amplicon sequencing approach targeting SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. ARTIC)
COVGAP will quality filter your reads and map them against the reference SARS-CoV-s genome, providing the variants in vcf format, and include them in a draft consensus genome. Only the variants showing high coverage and high alternative frequency (primary alleles variants) are included in the consensus. 
Alleles below the coverage or frequency thresholds (secondary alleles variants), and those alleles occurring as alternative to primary allele variants (alternative allele variants) are stored and annotated separately for the user consultation, but will NOT be part of the consensus.
Loci showing not enough coverage to allow a confident variant call are masked with N, instead of calling the reference. The consensi are labelled according to a user defined threshold of ambiguous base count (N) into LowCov (Ns above threshold), HighCov (Ns below threshold).

## Installation:
### Requirements:
- pyhton >= 3.7
- snakemake >= 5.26
- git >=1.8.3

You can install snakemake by creating a conda environment, as illustrated [here] (https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html):

### Installation:
Portability expansion is on its way, for the moment, we reccommend to clone the repository in a directory of your choice. The procedure was tested successfully in Linux and Mac operative systems.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/appliedmicrobiologyresearch/covgap/ /path/to/covgap
```

## Using covgap:
The initial reads need to be demultiplexed, paired end and tagged with `_R1.fastq.gz` and `_R2.fastq.gz`. To run the command with default options simply type:
```
snakemake -s path/to/covgap/covgap.smk --use-conda --cores 4
```
parameters are customisable by adding the flag `--config` followed by the parameter to be changed. A full list of the parameters follows:

| Parameter  | Description  | Default |
| :--------------- |:---------------------------:| -------:|
| read_dir      | Directory containing the demultiplexed raw reads | reads/ |
| QC_sliding_windows      | Sliding window used to scan the 5â€Ÿ end. It clips the read once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold         |   4 |
| QC_phred_score | Minimum quality threshold per base (phred score) used to trim the read (see above sliding window) | 20 |
| adapters | are neat        |    $1 |
| primers | are neat        |    $1 |
| ref_genome | are neat        |    $1 |
| mapr | are neat        |    $1 |
| unmapr | are neat        |    $1 |
| uptrim_threshold | are neat        |    $1 |
| variant_freq | are neat        |    $1 |
| variant_depth | are neat        |    $1 |
| n_threshold | are neat        |    $1 |
